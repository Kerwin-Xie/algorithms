# Transaction data analysis

Analyze your bank transactions.

This will very likely need major adjustments from your side as I doubt that the format is standardized.

## Prerequisites

1. Go to your bank and download the CSV file
2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run streamlit: `streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py`
4. This will generate a `private.config.yaml`. Adjust it to your needs.

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

This starts a local web server and opens a browser with the dashboard.

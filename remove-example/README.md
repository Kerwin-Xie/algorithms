A blogger posted [an article](http://stu.mp/2012/10/my-patent-pending-3-question-technical-interview.html)
about interview questions. One of them was:

I've added some sample files and directories for you to test if
your solution works.

If you want to reset the directory, you can use `git checkout -f HEAD`.

If you want to print the files, you can use `tree -a .`. This is the
example tree, that is generated:

```
 .
 |-- another folder
 |   |-- analysis.tex
 |   |-- test.tmp
 |   `-- .tmp
 |-- index.html
 |-- README.md
 |-- sample.tmp
 |   |-- inner.tmp
 |   |-- subfolder
 |   |   |-- inner2
 |   |   |   `-- abc.tmp
 |   |   |-- inner folder
 |   |   |   |-- asdf.tmp
 |   |   |   `-- gimp.txt
 |   |   |-- inner.tmp
 |   |   `-- .tmp
 |   `-- .tmp
 |-- test.tmp
 `-- .tmp
```

A correct command should result in:

```
.
|-- another folder
|   `-- analysis.tex
|-- index.html
|-- README.md
`-- sample.tmp
    `-- subfolder
        |-- inner2
        `-- inner folder
            `-- gimp.txt
```

rm
--
You should read [man rm](http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?rm).
Some options you should know are:

* *-r*: remove directories and their contents recursively


Why does(n't) this work?
------------------------
`rm -r *.tmp`

`find . -type f -name '*.tmp' -exec rm -rf {} \;`
